You can have fun and pretend that you are doing something useful for your organization at the same time! In this repository, I will record some simple design patterns to improve your code and remove unnecessary overhead in C++ . If you are a seasoned C++ expert, you probably have already a set of rules in your head that you always follow. These rules help you look like a bad-ass/rockstar/10X engineer to your colleagues. You are the kind of person that casually drops a std::vector<>::reserve before a loop and nods, smiling, looking at the performance improvement and the astonishment of your team member. Hopefully, the examples in this repository will help you achieve this status of guru and, as a side effect, save the planet from global warming, sparing useless CPU cycles from being wasted. Then, of course, someone on the other side of the planet will start mining Bitcoins or write her/his application in Python and all your effort to save electricity was for nothing. I am kidding, Python developers, we love you! Narrator: \"he was not kidding...\" Rule 1: measure first (using good tools) The very first thing any person concerned about performance should do is: Measure first and make hypothesis later . Me and my colleagues are almost always wrong about the reasons a piece of code is be slow. Sometimes we are right, but it is really hard to know in advance ho refactoring will improve performance. Good profiling tools show in minutes the \"low hanging fruits\": minimum work, maximum benefit! Summarizing: 10 Minutes profiling can save you hours of work guessing and refactoring. My \"goto\" tools in Linux are Hotspot and Heaptrack . I understand Windows has similar tools too. In the benchmark war, if you are the soldier, these are your rifle and hand grenades. Once you know which part of the code deserves to be optimized, you might want to use Google Benchmark to measure the time spent in a very specific class or function. You can even run it Google Benchmark online here: quick-bench.com . Rule 2: learn good design patterns, use them by default Writing good code is like brushing your teeth: you should do it without thinking too much about it. It is a muscle that you need to train, that will become stronger over time. But don't worry: once you start, you will start seeing recurring patterns that are surprisingly simple and works in many different use cases. Spoiler alert : one of my most beloved tricks is to minimize the number of heap allocations . You have no idea how much that helps. But let's make something absolutely clear: Your first goal as a developer (software engineer?) is to create code that is correct and fulfil the requirements. The second most important thing is to make your code maintainable and readable for other people. In many cases, you also want to make code faster, because faster code is better code . In other words, think twice before doing any change in your code that makes it less readable or harder to debug, just because you believe it may run 2.5% faster. Optimization examples \"If you pass that by value one more time...\" Use Const reference by default . Move semantic (TODO). Return value optimization (TODO). std::vector<> is your best friend Use std::vector<>::reserve by default \"I have learnt linked-lists at university, should I use them?\" Nooope . You don't need a std::map<> for that . Small vector optimization \"It is just a string, how bad could that be?\" Strings are (almost) vectors When not to worry: small string optimization . String concatenation: the false sense of security of operator+ . std::string_view : love at first sight (TODO). Don't compute things twice. Example: 2D/3D transforms the smart way.

Associative containers are used when you have pairs of key/value and you want to find a value given its key. But, because of the way the nodes of the red-black tree are created, std::map is not much different than an std::list , i.e. an unwelcome memory allocation during insertion and a very cache-unfriendly memory layout. Before selecting this data structure, ask yourself these questions: do I need all the pairs to be ordered by their keys? do I need to iterate often through all the items of the container? If the answer to the first question is \"no\", you may want to switch by default to std::unordered_map . In all my benchmarks, this was always a win. Maybe I was lucky and maybe there are situations in which std::map would perform better, but I haven't found those cases yet. If you answer \"yes\" to the second question... this will be interesting. Sit on my lap, my child, and join my optimization adventures. Optimizing the Velodyne driver This is a Pull Request I am particularly proud of: Avoid unnecessary computation in RawData::unpack To understand how a small change can make a huge difference, think about what this driver is doing. The Velodyne is a sensor that measures hundreds of thousands of points per seconds (distance from obstacles); it is the most important sensor in most autonomous cars. The Velodyne driver converts measurements in polar coordinates to 3D cartesian coordinates (the so-called \"PointCloud\"). I profiled the Velodyne driver using Hotspot and, surprise surprise, I found that something related to std::map::operator[] was using a lot of CPU. So I explored the code and I found this: std :: map < int , LaserCorrection > laser_corrections ; LaserCorrection contains some calibration information that was needed to adjust the measurements. The int key of the map is a number in the range [0, N-1], where N could be 16, 32 or 64. Maybe one day it will reach 128! Furthermore laser_corrections was created once (no further insertions) and used over and over again in a loop like this: // code simplified for ( int i = 0 ; i < BLOCKS_PER_PACKET ; i ++ ) { //some code for ( int j = 0 ; j < NUM_SCANS ; j ++ ) { int laser_number = // omitted for simplicity const LaserCorrection & corrections = laser_corrections [ laser_number ]; // some code } } Indeed, behind this innocent line of code: laser_corrections [ laser_number ] ; There is a search in a red-black tree! Remember: the index is not a random number, its value is always between 0 and N-1, where N is very small. So, I proposed this change and you can not imagine what happened next: std :: vector < LaserCorrection > laser_corrections ; Summarizing, there wasn't any need for an associative container, because the position in the vector itself (the index in the vector) is working just fine. I don't blame in any way the developers of the Velodyne driver, because changes like these make sense only in retrospective: until you profile your application and do some actual measurements, it is hard to find an unnecesary overhead hidden in plain sight. When you think that the rest of the function does a lot of mathematical operations, you can understand how counter-intuitive it is that the actual bottleneck was a tiny std::map . Going a step further: vector of [key,value] pairs This example was quite \"extreme\", because of its very convenient integer key, a small number between 0 and N. Nevertheless, in my code I use often a structure like this, instead of a \"real\" associative container: std :: vector < std :: pair < KeyType , ValueType > > my_map ; This is the best data structure if what you need to iterate frequently over all the elements . Most of the times, you can not beat it! \"But Davide, I need to have those elements ordered, that is the reason why I used std::map \"! Well, if you need them ordered... order them! std :: sort ( my_map . begin (), my_map . end () ) ; \"But Davide, sometimes I need to search an element in my map\" In that case, you can find your element by its key searching in an ordered vector with the function std::lower_bound . The complexity of lower_bound / upper_bound is O(log n) , the same as std::map , but iteration through all the elements is much, much faster. Summarizing Think about the way you want to access your data. Ask yourself if you have frequent or infrequent insertion/deletion. Do not underestimate the cost of an associative container.

In this example, we use add two comparisons to the condition: greater than (GT) 0.0 and less than (LT) 1.0. This condition is then used to build the filter. Let me rephrase it for people that are not familiar with PCL: An object is created that says: \"the Z value of the point must be greater than 0.0\". Another object is created saying: \"the Z value of the point must be less than 1.0\". They are both added to a ConditionAnd . We tell ConditionalRemoval to use this combined condition. Apply the filter to an input cloud to create a filtered one. Now think that the usal Point Cloud has a number of points in the order of tens of thousands or more. Think about it: Seriously, take some minutes to think how, given a vector of points that looks like this: // oversimplified, not the actual implementation struct PointXYZ { float x ; float y ; float z ; }; You want to create another point cloud with all the points that pass this condition: 0.0 < point.z < 1.0 I mean, if you ask me , this is what I would do, because I am not that smart: auto cloud_filtered = std :: make_shared < PointCloud < PointXYZ > (); for ( const auto & point : input_cloud -> points ) { if ( point . z > 0.0 && point . z < 1.0 ) { cloud_filtered -> push_back ( point ); } } This is what we will call the \"naive filter\" . Before showing you a benchmark that will knock your socks off (don't worry, I will), I must admit that it is an unfair comparison because the pcl filters do many more checks when processing your data to prevent weird corner cases.

When you push an element into an empty or full vector, we need to: allocate a new block of memory that is larger. move all the elements we have already stored in the previous block into the new one. Both these operations are expensive and we want to avoid them as much as possible, if you can, sometimes you just accept things the way they are. The size of the new block is 2X the capacity . Therefore, if you have a vector where both size() and capacity() are 100 elements and you push_back() element 101th, the block of memory (and the capacity) will jump to 200. To prevent these allocations, that may happen multiple times, we can reserve the capacity that we know (or believe) the vector needs. Let's have a look to a micro-benchmark. static void NoReserve ( benchmark :: State & state ) { for ( auto _ : state ) { // create a vector and add 100 elements std :: vector < size_t > v ; for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } static void WithReserve ( benchmark :: State & state ) { for ( auto _ : state ) { // create a vector and add 100 elements, but reserve first std :: vector < size_t > v ; v . reserve ( 100 ); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } static void ObsessiveRecycling ( benchmark :: State & state ) { // create the vector only once std :: vector < size_t > v ; for ( auto _ : state ) { // clear it. Capacity is still 100+ from previous run v . clear (); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } Look at the difference! And these are only 100 elements. The number of elements influence the final performance gain a lot, but one thing is sure: it will be faster. Note also as the ObsessiveRecycling brings a performance gain that is probably visible for small vectors, but negligible with bigger ones. Don't take me wrong, though: ObsessiveRecycling will always be faster, even if according to the size of the object you are storing you may or may not notice that difference. Recognizing a vector at first sight This is the amount of memory an applications of mine was using over time (image obtained with Heaptrack ): Look at that!

Therefore, if you have a vector where both size() and capacity() are 100 elements and you push_back() element 101th, the block of memory (and the capacity) will jump to 200. To prevent these allocations, that may happen multiple times, we can reserve the capacity that we know (or believe) the vector needs. Let's have a look to a micro-benchmark. static void NoReserve ( benchmark :: State & state ) { for ( auto _ : state ) { // create a vector and add 100 elements std :: vector < size_t > v ; for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } static void WithReserve ( benchmark :: State & state ) { for ( auto _ : state ) { // create a vector and add 100 elements, but reserve first std :: vector < size_t > v ; v . reserve ( 100 ); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } static void ObsessiveRecycling ( benchmark :: State & state ) { // create the vector only once std :: vector < size_t > v ; for ( auto _ : state ) { // clear it. Capacity is still 100+ from previous run v . clear (); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ){ v . push_back ( i ); } } } Look at the difference! And these are only 100 elements. The number of elements influence the final performance gain a lot, but one thing is sure: it will be faster. Note also as the ObsessiveRecycling brings a performance gain that is probably visible for small vectors, but negligible with bigger ones. Don't take me wrong, though: ObsessiveRecycling will always be faster, even if according to the size of the object you are storing you may or may not notice that difference.","title":"... when you use reserve"},{"location":"reserve/#recognizing-a-vector-at-first-sight","text":"This is the amount of memory an applications of mine was using over time (image obtained with Heaptrack ): Look at that!
